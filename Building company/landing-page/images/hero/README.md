# Hero Images

Drop your hero background image here.

**File name:** `hero-bg.jpg` (or `.png`, `.webp`)

**Recommended size (so it doesn’t look low-res):**
- **Minimum:** 1920×1080px (16:9)
- **Better:** 2560×1440px — stays sharp on most laptops and phones
- **Best:** 3840×2160px (4K) or at least 2880×1620px — stays sharp on Retina/high-DPI screens

Use one high-res file as `hero-bg.jpg`. The page scales it with `background-size: cover`, so a 2560px or 3840px-wide image will look sharp everywhere and won’t look pixelated on Retina.

**Quality:**
- Save as JPEG with **quality 80–90** (avoid going under ~80 or it can look blurry).
- Prefer **.jpg** or **.webp**; keep file size under ~500KB–1MB if you can (use TinyPNG/Squoosh if needed).

**What to use:**
- Job site photo showing quality work
- Action shot of carpentry in progress
- Finished project exterior/interior
- Team working together

**Tips:**
- Use a high-quality, well-lit photo
- Avoid busy backgrounds (text will overlay)
- The image will be darkened with an overlay for text readability
