    {
      q: "Is this actually legit?",
      a: "Yes. We're fully licenced (builder's licence number in the footer), ABN registered, and insured. Ed runs the tools; a business partner handles quoting, scheduling, and admin. It's a proper setup, not a cash job."
    },
    {
      q: "How much do you pay, and when?",
      a: "We pay [your rate range] per hour/day. Weekly bank transfer, every Friday. No exceptions, no 'the cheque's in the mail.'"
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need my own tools?",
      a: "We provide major power tools, consumables, and PPE. You bring your hand tools. If you're unsure, ask when we chat."
    },
    {
      q: "What area do you work in?",
      a: "[Your suburbs/regions]. We're based in [region]. If you're in the area, the travel works."
    },
    {
      q: "I'm an apprentice — is there a role for me?",
      a: "Yes. We take apprentices seriously. You'll be on the tools with Ed from day one, not just sweeping up. We support TAFE and block release."
    },
    {
      q: "What kind of work do you do?",
      a: "Residential renos mainly: bathrooms, kitchens, decks, structural work, fit-outs. Variety — not the same job every day."
    },
    {
      q: "How quickly will I hear back?",
      a: "Within 48 hours. We'll text you (SMS), not email. If you don't hear back in 48 hours, chase us — something went wrong."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I keep my current job and just do weekends?",
      a: "Yes. We offer weekend and flexible work now. No pressure to go full-time until you're ready."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens on the trial day?",
      a: "You come out on a real job, work alongside the team, see if it's a fit. You get paid for the day no matter what. No obligations."
    },
    {
      q: "Who's actually running this?",
      a: "Ed runs the jobs and the crew. A business partner handles everything else — quoting, clients, scheduling, admin. So you do the work; we handle the rest."
